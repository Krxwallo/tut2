Basics
------

Your general time tracking happens on the track screen (/track).

Each line is one entry. Create a new entry whenever you start a new
task. Create a new entry by clicking on any of the fields in the top,
greyed out, entry template. Enter all details as desired.

You can resume tasks which you have worked on in the past by clicking
on the desired entry's "play" icon ("recently used entries").

Edit any existing entries by simply clicking on the field you would
like to change. Then either select the desired contents from the
autosuggest-dropdown, or manually enter text.


Settings
--------

Change application settings on the settings page (/settings). In
particular, configure

 * time zone (specify a specific time zone, or choose autoselect to
   automaticalle pick the shown time zone based on browser/OS
   settings)

 * precision (with/without seconds). Note: time entries are always
   stored with ms resolution internally.

 * check/sync time (verify that local browser time is anything like
   actual current time)



Reports
-------

Switch any day to "report" view by clicking on the "pie chart"
icon. Switch back to entry-by-entry view by clicking on the "list"
icon.

Generate daily/weekly/etc reports on the reports page (/report).
