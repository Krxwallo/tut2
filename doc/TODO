Calculate duration in GUI

Proper editing of start time in GUI

Drag-drop-editing of start time in GUI



Consider if we really need the "last synced" Sync State entries, or if they're
simply an extra complication (speed optimisation).

When entering a new log entry by clicking on the template, the currently
displayed timestamp gets copied to the new entry (in view), whereas the correct
"current time" gets registered internally. This means the display is wrong until
the first refresh. Fix!

Convert syncing algorithm to asynchronous.

Implement actual AJAX-syncing with server...

UI
==

(1)
Burger-Symbol.
Drag to the left of time: move entry to other position in
list of entries, adjust start time intelligently (e.g. half-way).

(2)
Updown-Symbol
Drag to the right of time: adjust start time in 5min / 15min / 1h
intervals. Stop at next/previous entry? Move next/previous entries
along with this one?

(3)
UNDO functionality!

(4)
Enter time/date manually.

(5)
Enter duration manually

(6)
Adjust duration with drag-and-drop



DONE
====

Handle multiple users.

Implement "resume" button.
Implement "delete" button.
...and update sync method to cope along the way.


Deal with "delete" properly: 
 - "deleted" entries are just ordinary entries with the "deleted" attribute
   set.
 - Sync just like everything else. But simply don't display them.
 - Later maybe consider some special cases where deleted items don't need
   to be synced downstream in the first place.

Add callbacks into model to inform view about start/end of syncing.
