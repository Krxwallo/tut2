TODO

Deal with "delete" properly: 
 - "deleted" entries are just ordinary entries with the "deleted" attribute
   set.
 - Sync just like everything else. But simply don't display them.
 - Later maybe consider some special cases where deleted items don't need
   to be synced downstream in the first place.


Consider if we really need the "last synced" Sync State entries, or if they're
simply an extra complication (speed optimisation).



DONE

Implement "resume" button.
Implement "delete" button.
...and update sync method to cope along the way.
