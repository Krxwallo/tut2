Testing Syncing
===============

Start with deleted localStorage. Then refresh page.
- will fill local model with some example entries

Sync to localstorage. This will test part 2 of the algorithm,
since the remote end is empty at this stage.

After the sync...
- localStorage will contain the two example items
- syncState will indicate that we last synced revisions 101 and 102
  for the two entries, respectively. The overall highest synced
  revision will be 102.
- syncState will indicate that we last synced server (upstream)
  revisions 2 and 3 for the two entries, respectively. The overall
  highest synced revision from upstream will be 3.

(note: highes rev no we have from upstream doesn't get updated as of yet!!)
